Create a project using command:

    - npx create-react-app <app name>

Cd into the project directory

Install the following dependencies using "npm install ":

    npm install @material-ui/core

    npm install react-router

    npm install axios

    npm install mdbreact

    npm install react-md


Copy paste the src and public folders of this repo in the react project directory

npm-start to deploy

localhost:3000 for mainfeed

localhost:3000/CreatePost for creating a post

localhost:3000/Trending for trending

localhost:3000/Profile for profile


---


Tasks pending in front end:

* Component to show a single post (Need to redirect to this once a new post is uploaded or existing post is clicked from main feed)

* Signup and login form

* Updating the main feed without refreshing the page

* Post comments (not done)

* Image sent as prop from mainfeed.jsx does not load in post.jsx (Possible solution is webpack?)

* Pages for trending and profile

* The intelligent feature of the project (Suggesting similar posts what a user would like)
